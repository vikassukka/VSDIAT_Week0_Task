# VSDIAT_Week0_Task
Week 0 task submission

//soc design flow 
In the week 0 lecture explained about SYSTEM ON CHIP(SOC)
STEP1:
o1: SPECIFICATIONS
-high level specifications written in c language .
-to compile the c code in linux we use the compiler like GCC.
STEP2:
O2:RTL DESIGN
-hardware described using rtl(verilog)
-processor and pheripherals are defined.
-output: gate level netlist,macros,analog inputs.
STEP3 : 
o3:SOC INTEGRTION
-Integration of processor ,pheripherals,macros and analog inputs.
-verified 01=02=03.
STEP4:
o4-FINAL CHIP
-Physical implementation
-verified 01=02=03=04


o1=02 (cmodel vs rtl)
o2=03 (rtl vs gate level netlist)
o3=o4 (gatelevel vs layout)
